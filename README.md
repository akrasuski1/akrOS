Unfortunately, this thing does not work for now - this is because of lib_exec is not working in current version of kOS, and akrOS was heavily relying on that functionality. Probably this project will be stalled until the new version of kOS is released - as I heard, it will have delegates ("function pointers"), which will enable me to make this thing worka gain (albeit with a lot of rewriting).
